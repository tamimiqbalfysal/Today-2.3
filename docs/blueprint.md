- Accent color: Electric Purple (#7C4DFF), slightly lighter and more saturated than the primary, draws attention to key elements and CTAs without overpowering the overall design.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. Body text font: 'Inter', sans-serif.
- Clean and minimalist layout with ample white space to provide a professional and trustworthy impression. Content should be organized into clear sections.
- Use simple, modern icons (outline style) to represent products and features. Icons should use the accent color (#7C4DFF).
- Subtle fade-in effects for page elements as the user scrolls, enhancing engagement without distracting from the core content.
